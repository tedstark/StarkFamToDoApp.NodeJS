# StarkFamToDoApp.NodeJS

This project is hosted online [here](https://tws-app01.herokuapp.com/)!

Our personal project was very open-ended giving us full creative control on what to make and/or what to do. Once our [scope](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CXKu2SBiXJTveR-7KPmo8l-QiKO1IWxiq9o06056mg0/edit?usp=sharing) was approved by the insructor, we had two weeks of class time along with a third week of Spring break in the middle of those two weeks.  

Originally, I had planned to do this project in Java with Spring, however, after most of my first week, spent in developemnt and research, I failed to have significant progress on the project and began learning Node and Express for the login, RESTful API, and other functionality.  I was able to successfully finish almost all Primary and Secondary pieces of functionality of the application in the next two weeks.

This project took place in the third month of the bootcamp after 9 weeks of full-time instruction/learning.
